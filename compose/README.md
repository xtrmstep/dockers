# Local Environment

The file .env is ignored. You need to created it from .linux.env or .win.env (just copy whole content) depends on your OS.

Set system environment variable in Ubuntu:

1. modify /etc/environment
2. add a line with the variable: LOCAL_DOCKER_VOLUMES="/you/local/docker/volumes/" (close with /)
